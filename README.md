# Stealthburner CW2 LGX Lite mount with microswitch filament sensor for ERCF

Note: The original idea and the base cad models came from the following repository [LGX_Lite_Stealthburner_CW2_style_mount](https://www.google.com](https://github.com/Eytecz/LGX_Lite_Stealthburner_CW2_style_mount/tree/main)https://github.com/Eytecz/LGX_Lite_Stealthburner_CW2_style_mount/tree/main). After numerous attempts, I was unable to make it work with a hall effect sensor (It was constantly failing after few days) and because of that, I decided to make a mount that uses a micro switch. I will list the instructions for mounting the microswitch but you should refer to the repository mentioned above for more detailed assembly instructions.

Filament sensor requires two parts

* D2F-01L Switch (Other switches with similar dimensions should work just fine)
* 6x3 magnet (You don`t really need a magnet, anything with 6mmx3mm should work). It is very important to have the radius of the cylinder as close to 6mm as possible. Height does not need to be as accurate but aim for < 3mm.

# Assembly instructions and tips

#1: Magnet insertion
Insert the magnet into the Front_body_LGX_Lite_Stealthburner_ERCF magnet hole. Make sure the magnet can move freely within the hole. There must be no resistance when moving the magnet. The magnet should enter the filament hole by about 1.25mm.

#2: Button wiring
Solder two wires to the button and pass the wires through the holes at the back of the button hole in Rear_body_LGX_Lite_Stealthburner_ERCF part. I will talk more about my personal preference for wiring at the end of this document.
