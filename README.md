# Stealthburner CW2 LGX Lite mount with microswitch filament sensor for ERCF

Note: The original idea and the base cad models came from the following repository [LGX_Lite_Stealthburner_CW2_style_mount](https://www.google.com](https://github.com/Eytecz/LGX_Lite_Stealthburner_CW2_style_mount/tree/main)https://github.com/Eytecz/LGX_Lite_Stealthburner_CW2_style_mount/tree/main). After numerous attempts, I was unable to make it work with a hall effect sensor (It was constantly failing after few days) and because of that, I decided to make a mount that uses a micro switch. I will list the instructions for mounting the microswitch but you should refer to the repository mentioned above for more detailed assembly instructions.
